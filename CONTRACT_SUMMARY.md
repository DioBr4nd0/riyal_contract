## 📊 CONTRACT STATISTICS

- **Instructions**: 15 public functions
- **Account Types**: 2 (TokenState, UserData)
- **Error Codes**: 43 comprehensive error types
- **Security Level**: Enterprise-grade
- **Test Coverage**: 3 comprehensive test suites

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURE

### Account Structure
```rust
TokenState PDA {
    admin: Pubkey,
    token_mint: Pubkey,
    treasury_account: Pubkey,
    upgrade_authority: Pubkey,
    // ... state flags and configuration
}

UserData PDA {
    user: Pubkey,
    nonce: u64,
    last_claim_timestamp: i64,
    next_allowed_claim_time: i64,
    total_claims: u64,
}
```

### Key Instructions
1. `initialize` - Set up contract with admin and configuration
2. `create_token_mint` - Create SPL token with PDA as authority
3. `mint_tokens` - Admin mint with automatic freezing
4. `claim_tokens` - User claims with signature verification
5. `enable_transfers` - Permanently enable token transfers
6. `burn_tokens` - Admin burn with user authorization
7. `create_treasury` - Set up contract treasury
8. `update_time_lock` - Configure claim time restrictions
